                        This website was originally created on 180306 (two digit year, two digit month, two digit day), my mother's 63rd birthday, for my LaunchCode class. 
                        However, watermarking and getting a storefront full of pictures from my life has been on my bucket list since 2003. 
                    </p> <p>Since I do yet know how to mass watermark my images for sale, I will only post three, one from each category. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I will include two that are from &quot;My favorite moment.&quot;  Each image was taken with moments of the other, facing 180 degrees opposite.</p>
